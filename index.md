  <h1>Turing AI Fellows and Teams Community Hackathon (30th and 31st of March 2023)</h1>
  <p>
    One of the key aspects to advance the Artificial Intelligence field is to build communities around ML and its applications. 
    As a step towards this goal, we are holding the first Turing AI Fellows Community Hackathon, which will enable ML and domain 
    experts to share their knowledge and start building research collaborations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hackathon participants will form teams and select one (or more) research problems to address during their two days at Cambridge. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    Participants can select research problems from the following list:
    <ul>
      <li>Causal discovery for cancer</li>
      <li>
        <a target="_blank" href="./materials/problem_2/grid_operation.html">
          Learning to run a power network
        </a>
      </li> 
      <li>
        <a target="_blank" href="./materials/problem_3/low_cost_prediction.html">
          Low cost climate prediction
        </a>
      </li>  
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Each team will give a short presentation at the end of the second day to summarise their work.
