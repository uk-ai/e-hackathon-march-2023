<h2>Task introduction & significance</h2>

<p>
  Climate prediction models will play a key role in effectively modelling the Earthâ€™s changing climate. The current trade-off between 
  predictions cost and accuracy is an open challenge that needs to be addressed as heterogeneous observational data becomes more readily 
  available.
</p>

<p>
  Simulators are useful for modelling climate and weather patterns, however when using simulators, there is often a trade-off between cost 
  and accuracy. Low-fidelity data can be produced easily using inexpensive and approximate simulation methods, yet it often deviates significantly 
  from reality. In contrast, high-fidelity data may more closely resemble the real-world system. This can be gathered from real-world measurements 
  or computationally expensive simulations.
</p>

<p>
  Multi-fidelity modelling provides a useful framework for combining the accuracy of high-fidelity data with the low cost of low-fidelity data.
  The goal is to develop computational methods to provide high-fidelity climate predictions from low-fidelity data. Each team is free to explore and 
  propose its own methodologies and solution but a first step towards the goal of this task can be to reproduce the results presented by Hudson et al.[1]. 
  This work provides high-fidelity climate predictions from low-fidelity data for a mountainous region within Peru. The data is available 
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scotthosking/mf_modelling/tree/main/data">
    here
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  Teams can explore validate their models with other datasets once they have an initial model to provide high-fidelity climate predictions from low fidelity data.
